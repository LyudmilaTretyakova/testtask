# testtask

In script.py my try to solve Wikipedia link, I use python and asyncio for more quickly work, but maybe I need use asyncio+threads for this. 
So after link I recommend use space, and after n=3 it works very slowly. 

P.S. In comments my bad decision do this without asyncio and there I study to use asyncio library. 

Thanks for your time. I will appreciate to get feedback of my work.

Have a nice day!
